      <h1> My Mother's Kimchijigae Recipe </h1> 
      <img src ="../Recipe-images/Kimchijjigae.jpeg">
      <p>
        Growing up, this was my favourite dish to eat. I would always ask my mom
        to make it, because hers was undisputedly the best, better than all of the kimchijigaes
        I tried at my local restuarants. I always told her that if she ever retired, 
        she could open up a <em> kimchijigae </em> restaurant because of how good it was.

        <ol> 
          <li> Wash and cut zucchini and mushrooms. Finely mince the garlic. </li> 
          <li> Heat a pan over medium heat with the water water. Add the bay leaves, black pepper, coffee, doenjang, ginger, 
            and minced garlic. Then add the pork belly. 
          </li>
          <li> Add the kimchi and kimchi juice. 
          </li>
          <li> Cook for about twenty minutes, periodically opening the lid to check if the water has evaporated. 
            Make sure the bottom of the pan dosen't burn, adding water when needed. 
          </li>
          <li> Add the vegetables on top of the kimchi, spooning some of the sauce over
            them. Cook for an additional 10 minutes.

          <li> Cut the tofu block into slices, then place them over the veggies. Once again,
            spoon some of the sauce over the tofu to help it absorb all the flavours. Cook for 5-10 minutes more.
          </li>
          <li> Turn off the heat and garnish with green onions. Eat with a bowl of rice!
